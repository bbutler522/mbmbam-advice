# MBMBAM Advice Search
Search the My Brother, My Brother, and Me archives to see if they've given advice on something. This repo isn't for kids! which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for coding. Whats up you cool baby?

## Contributing

All contributors welcome! Ideas are welcome as issue submissions, issues are welcome to be tackled and submitted as PRs, and anything else feel free to email me

We'll keep track of all contributors! 

## Frontend

We can host through github pages since we won't need anything too complex.

### Inspiration

http://wonderful.fyi/



## Backend

We'll need a way to process transcripts, store them, and have them accessible.
